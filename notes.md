Im starting to understand how to use git in vscode. 
I did not know any of this so basicly any thing it talked about is new 
In HTML today i learn how when adding links and things like that you must use "" and for links to use <a href="link">what shows up</a>

my websites ip is 54.84.66.217 and mcmodi.click will take you there aswell and to look at my server must remember to make sure it is set N. Virginia.
