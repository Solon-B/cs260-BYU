Im starting to understand how to use git in vscode. 
I did not know any of this so basicly any thing it talked about is new 
In HTML today i learn how when adding links and things like that you must use "" and for links to use <a href="link">what shows up</a>

my websites ip is 54.84.66.217 and mcmodi.click will take you there aswell and to look at my server must remember to make sure it is set N. Virginia. 


made my server secure my ip was set to 00 but not the ssh only https and http so i would time out and not give noraml erros. command s to insert adn then control o write :qw to exit than sudo service caddy restart
